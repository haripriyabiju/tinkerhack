### Hosted Project Link

### Project Description
This project predicts the likelihood of floods based on annual rainfall data, utilizing machine learning to classify flood risk.

### The Problem Statement
Flood prediction is crucial for early warning systems, but accurately predicting when floods will occur based solely on rainfall data is a significant challenge.

### The Solution
We solve this by using a Random Forest Classifier, which takes in annual rainfall as the sole feature and predicts whether a flood is likely to occur based on a threshold value.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- *Languages used*: Python
- *Frameworks used*: Flask (for API), Scikit-learn (for machine learning), Pandas, Numpy
- *Libraries used*: joblib (for saving models), Flask-CORS
- *Tools used*: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook

### Implementation
For Software:

# Installation
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Run
bash
python app.py

OUTPUT.
This is the output interface of a flood warning system that predicts whether there will be a flood based on annual rainfall (in mm). The system takes user input for rainfall, but the displayed error indicates a mismatch in input dimensions. Specifically, the OneHotEncoder expects 2 features, but the system currently provides only 1 feature as input.

BACKEND
This is the backend API code for a flood prediction system built with Flask. It loads a pre-trained model (flood_prediction_model.pkl) and an encoder (encoder (1).pkl) to process input data.

Routes:
'/': Serves the HTML frontend.
'/predict': Handles POST requests for predictions.
The terminal shows warnings about mismatched input dimensions, as the model expects more features than the frontend provides.

A PICTURE OF OUR MODEL
I trained my model using a dataset from Kaggle to predict rainfall. After preprocessing‚Äîscaling numerical features and splitting the data‚ÄîI used a regression model for prediction. The model's performance was evaluated using *MSE* and *R¬≤ (0.69)*, showing a decent correlation. I also plotted actual vs. predicted values to visualize accuracy.

When a user opens the Flood Warning System, they are prompted to enter the rainfall value and click the Predict button. This input is sent to the backend API, where a trained machine learning model analyzes the data and predicts flood risk.  

The system then returns a result to the user, displaying either Flood Risk: High ‚ö†Ô∏è if flooding is likely or No Flood Risk ‚úÖ" if there is no danger. This ensures quick and data-driven flood warnings.

the video demonstration of executing a fire alarm system.We are entering the rainfall measurement at particular place. it is then sent to the backend api that decides whether the rainfall level will lead to a flood or not. it the sents back the prediction. However since we couldn't fix some errors, we couldn't generate the correct response
